### Basic Workflow

1. **Select an Adapter**: Click on a network adapter from the left panel
2. **Configure IP**: 
   - Choose DHCP or Static IP mode
   - Enter IP details if using static
   - Click "Apply IP Configuration"
3. **Configure DNS**:
   - Select a preset from the DNS list, or
   - Choose custom DNS and enter server addresses
   - Click "Apply DNS Configuration"
   - Click "Register DoH" or "Register DoT" to add Windows encrypted DNS metadata for compatible resolvers
   - Click "Test Health" to validate encrypted DNS handshakes and DNS-message responses
   - Configure the DoQ local proxy path/upstream and click "Start Proxy" when using DNS-over-QUIC
   - Enter a NextDNS config ID and click "Apply NextDNS" to populate account-specific encrypted endpoints
4. **Save as Profile** (optional):
   - Go to Profiles tab
   - Click "Create New Profile"
   - Capture current SSID/gateway MAC when the profile should auto-apply
   - Optionally schedule a profile for a recurring day/time switch
   - Optionally set environment actions such as network category, proxy, default printer, or mapped drives
   - Click "Preview Diff" to review changes against the selected adapter
   - Fill in details and save
   - Use the header Import button to import NetForge JSON exports or Windows WLAN profile XML exports
   - Use `.\NetForge.ps1 -ApplyProfile Home -Silent` from scripts to apply a saved profile without launching the window
5. **Launch RDP with a profile** (optional):
   - Go to Network Tools
   - Enter a host or `.rdp` file and saved profile name
   - Click "Launch RDP with Profile"
   - NetForge reverts the captured pre-RDP network state when the RDP client exits
6. **Restrict an app to one interface** (optional):
   - Go to Network Tools
   - Browse to an `.exe`, choose the allowed adapter, and click "Apply Guard"
   - NetForge blocks that app on other current adapters using Windows Firewall interface filters
7. **Diagnose reachability**:
   - Go to Network Tools
   - Enter a host, URL, IP address, or `host:port`
   - Click "Why Can't I Reach X?" to check DNS, gateway, route, TCP/firewall, and MTU signals
8. **Manage WiFi**:
   - Go to the WiFi tab
   - Click "Scan Networks"
   - Select a network and click "Connect" or "Disconnect"
9. **Control external diagnostics**:
   - Go to Diagnostics
   - Disable public-IP lookup or external speed-test downloads when working offline or privately

## Configuration Storage

NetForge stores its configuration in:
```
%APPDATA%\NetForge\    # Default location; profiles can be moved to a selected sync folder
|-- Profiles\          # Saved network profiles (.json)
|-- Logs\              # Operation and crash logs
`-- settings.json      # Application settings
```

Set `UiLocale` in `settings.json` to a shipped locale such as `en-US` or `es-ES` to change the UI language on the next launch.
Set `PublicIpLookupEnabled`, `ExternalSpeedTestEnabled`, `SpeedTestEndpoint`, and `DiscordWebhookEnabled` in `settings.json` or use the Diagnostics endpoint-policy panel to control external diagnostic calls and profile notifications. Discord webhook URLs are stored as current-user protected data after entry through the Diagnostics tab or legacy settings migration.

## Troubleshooting

### Script Won't Run
```powershell
# Set execution policy (run as admin)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Access Denied Errors
- Ensure you're running as Administrator
- The script will auto-elevate, but UAC must be approved

### Adapter Not Showing
- Virtual adapters are filtered by default
- Only physical Ethernet and Wi-Fi adapters are displayed
- Click "Refresh Adapters" to update the list

### DNS Changes Not Taking Effect
1. Try flushing DNS cache (Network Tools > Flush DNS Cache)
2. Release and renew IP address
3. Restart the network adapter
